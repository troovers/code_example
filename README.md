An example of a project I'm currently working on.

I'm currently working on a project called Club Manager with an attached app for members. The Club Manager serves as an administrating tool for sports clubs. For example, it helps the club to save the (former) members and sponsors, easily send newsletters and keep track of activities. Another feature is the connection with the app for the members. Users can add activities, articles or polls to the Club Manager, of which a member will be notified in the app. These features have been selected to give an impression of the code I've written and the Club Manager itself. The files are divided over a view folders, such as Controllers, for the access points, Models for the database structure and access, Views for the user and Commands for artisan. 

If you have any questions, you can always send me an email via thomas@geekk.nl.
